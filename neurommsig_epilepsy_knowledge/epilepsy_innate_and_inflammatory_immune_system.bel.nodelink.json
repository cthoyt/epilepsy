However, chronic inflammatory processes within the brain and associated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment often cause neurotoxicity and hyperexcitability.Mounting evidence points to a mutual facilitation between inflammation and epilepsy, suggesting that blocking the undesired inflammatory signaling within the brain might provide novel strategies to treat seizures and epilepsy. Neuroinflammation is primarily characterized by the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators in epileptogenic foci, among which cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been extensively studied.",
